  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to Navigation.tsx adding an admin link and updates to file summaries/project state documenting an AdminPage with passcode protection. However, the actual AdminPage.tsx implementation is not included in the diff, making it impossible to verify the complete implementation of REQ-14's acceptance criteria.",

      "requirement": "Restore the admin panel interface that displays both the passcode-protected ItemForm component for adding products and the ItemList component for viewing/managing existing products",
      "reason": "The diff does not include the actual AdminPage.tsx implementation file. While frontend-file-summaries.txt mentions AdminPage.tsx with passcode 3415, the file itself is not in the modified files list, so we cannot verify that the ItemForm and ItemList components are properly displayed together, or that the passcode protection and layout match the acceptance criteria",

      "requirement": "Ensure the admin panel remains accessible within the application's routing structure",
