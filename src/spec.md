# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the admin panel with passcode-protected product management interface.

**Planned changes:**
- Re-add the admin panel interface that was previously removed
- Display the passcode entry field requiring '3415' to unlock the product form
- Show the ItemForm component for adding products after passcode verification
- Display the ItemList component showing all existing products with delete functionality
- Ensure the admin route is accessible within the application

**User-visible outcome:** Users can access the admin panel, enter the passcode '3415', and manage products by adding new items or deleting existing ones through the restored interface.
